    "Product Long Description": [
      "EaseMyTrip commenced its operations in 2008 by focusing on the B2B2C (business to business to customer) distribution channel and providing travel agents access to its website to book domestic travel airline tickets in order to cater to the offline travel market in India. Subsequently, by leveraging its B2B2C channel, the company commenced operations in the B2C (business to customer) distribution channel in 2011 by primarily focusing on the growing Indian middle class population’s travel requirements. With our presence in the B2B2C and B2C channels, we were able to commence operations in the B2E (business to enterprise) distribution channel in 2013 with the aim of providing end-to-end travel solutions to corporates. Our presence in three distinct distribution channels provide us with a diversified customer base and wide distribution network. We have been providing customers with the option of no-convenience fee, such that customers are not required to pay any service fee in instances where there are no alternate discount or promotion coupon being availed. In our pricing model, we have endeavoured to avoid hidden costs, which result in increasing the final price payable by the customer. We believe that the strength of our brand, the quality of our services, our user-friendly websites (www.easemytrip.com and www.easemytrip.in), android and iOS based mobile applications (EaseMyTrip), our customer centric approach, as well as our efficient marketing programs have enabled us to develop significant market share in the domestic airline ticket business in India. In Fiscal 2019, GoAir, and SpiceJet, recognized us as amongst the top travel partners in terms of revenue and passenger count. The strength of our brand has increased significantly over the years."
